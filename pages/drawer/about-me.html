  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <div class="about-summary">
    <p>
      Based in Bucharest, Romania, I'm a part-time Android developer at Digi România who loves pairing Kotlin and
      Jetpack Compose work with UI/UX design and animation. Recent releases like Smart Cleaner for Android keep me
      focused on solving everyday problems with thoughtful mobile experiences.

  <section class="about-section">
    <h2 class="section-title">Community & Learning</h2>
    <p>
      I keep my apps open-source so anyone can learn from or remix the code, and I’m always up for collaborations around
      Jetpack Compose or design systems. Continuous learning fuels that mindset—earning badges such as the Modern Android
      App Architecture pathway, Google Cloud Innovator, and the “Completed 10+ Codelabs” milestone keeps my practice sharp.

  <section class="about-section">
    <h2 class="section-title">Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>
      UI/UX design, animations, and Kotlin-first development shape every project. I look for opportunities to craft Compose
      interfaces that feel cohesive from motion to layout.
