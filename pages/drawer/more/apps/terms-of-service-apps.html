    <p>Welcome to my Android applications (the "App" or "Apps", "Service") provided by <strong>Mihai-Cristian Condrea</strong> ("I," "me," or "my"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of my Apps. Please read them carefully before downloading or using any of my Apps.</p>
    <p>By downloading, accessing, or using any of my Apps, you agree to be bound by these Terms and my <a href="#privacy-policy-end-user-software">Privacy Policy – End-User Software</a>. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use my Apps.</p>

    <md-divider></md-divider>

    <h2>1. License to Use My Apps</h2>
    <p>I grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use my Apps for your personal, non-commercial purposes, subject to these Terms.</p>
    <p>You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of my Apps or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of my Apps, unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have my written permission. The Apps themselves, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to them, still belong to Mihai-Cristian Condrea.</p>

    <md-divider></md-divider>

    <h2>2. Age Requirements</h2>
    <p>My Apps are not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of digital consent in your jurisdiction). If you are under this age, you may only use the Apps with the consent and supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms.</p>

    <md-divider></md-divider>

    <h2>3. App Functionality and Updates</h2>
    <p>Mihai-Cristian Condrea is committed to ensuring that the Apps are as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, I reserve the right to make changes to the Apps or to charge for certain services or features, at any time and for any reason. I will never charge you for an App or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
    <p>My Apps may store and process personal data as described in my <a href="#privacy-policy-end-user-software">Privacy Policy – End-User Software</a> to provide my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the Apps secure. I therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features, and it could mean that my Apps won’t work properly or at all.</p>
    <p>At some point, I may wish to update an App. The Apps are currently available on Android – the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems I decide to extend the availability of the Apps to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the App. Mihai-Cristian Condrea does not promise that it will always update the Apps so that they are relevant to you and/or work with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you.</p>

    <md-divider></md-divider>

    <h2>4. In-App Purchases and Donations</h2>
    <p>Some of my Apps may offer in-app purchases (IAPs) or opportunities to make voluntary donations (e.g., "Feast," "Dinner," "Coffee," "Lunch"). These are one-time purchases and are not subscriptions unless explicitly stated.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose of Donations:</strong> Donations are entirely voluntary and are intended to support the ongoing development, maintenance, and improvement of my Apps and other projects. They help me dedicate more time and resources to creating and enhancing my free offerings.</li>
        <li><strong>No Obligation:</strong> Making a donation does not entitle you to any additional features, content, or services beyond what is already available in the App, unless specifically described as a benefit of a particular IAP.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> All IAPs and donations are processed through the Google Play Store's billing system. I do not collect or store your payment information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Refund Policy for In-App Purchases/Donations</h3>
    <p>I adhere to the Google Play refund policies for all in-app purchases and donations made through my Apps.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Eligibility via Google Play:</strong> You can typically request a refund directly from Google Play within 48 hours of the purchase. Please refer to Google Play's official support documentation for instructions on how to request a refund.</li>
        <li><strong>Requests After 48 Hours:</strong> After the 48-hour window provided by Google Play has passed, refunds are generally not available unless required by applicable law. You may contact me directly at <a href="mailto:contact.mihaicristiancondrea@gmail.com">contact.mihaicristiancondrea@gmail.com</a> with your purchase details and reason for the request. However, granting refunds after this period is at my sole discretion.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Refundable Items:</strong> Unless otherwise required by law, digital products such as one-time donations or unlocked features via IAPs are considered final and non-refundable once purchased and delivered.</li>
        <li><strong>Abuse of Policy:</strong> I reserve the right to refuse refund requests if I suspect abuse of this policy (e.g., repeated requests for the same item).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For any issues related to unauthorized or fraudulent purchases, please contact Google Play support immediately.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>My Apps may use or integrate with third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions. By using my Apps, you may also be subject to the terms of these third parties.</p>
    <p>Links to Terms and Conditions of key third-party service providers used by my Apps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Services</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdMob (Google)</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am not responsible for the practices or content of these third-party services.</p>

    <md-divider></md-divider>

    <h2>6. Internet Connection and Data Charges</h2>
    <p>Certain functions of my Apps will require an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. Mihai-Cristian Condrea cannot take responsibility for an App not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
    <p>If you’re using an App outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the App, or other third-party charges. In using an App, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the App outside of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using an App, please be aware that I assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the App.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL MIHAI-CRISTIAN CONDREA, NOR ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, OR AFFILIATES, BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (I) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE; (II) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE; (III) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICE; AND (IV) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
    <p>WE ENDEAVOR TO ENSURE THAT OUR APPS ARE UPDATED AND CORRECT AT ALL TIMES, BUT WE DO RELY ON THIRD PARTIES TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO US SO THAT WE CAN MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO YOU. MIHAI-CRISTIAN CONDREA ACCEPTS NO LIABILITY FOR ANY LOSS, DIRECT OR INDIRECT, YOU EXPERIENCE AS A RESULT OF RELYING WHOLLY ON THE FUNCTIONALITY OF ANY APP.</p>

    <md-divider></md-divider>

    <h2>8. Termination</h2>
    <p>I may terminate or suspend your access to my Apps immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>
    <p>Upon termination, your right to use the Apps will immediately cease. (a) The rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the App, and (if needed) delete it from your device. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

    <md-divider></md-divider>

    <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Romania, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
    <p>My failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between me regarding my Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements I might have had between me regarding the Service.</p>

    <md-divider></md-divider>

    <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>I reserve the right, at my sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, I will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect, typically by posting the new Terms on this page or through an in-app notification. What constitutes a material change will be determined at my sole discretion.</p>
    <p>By continuing to access or use my Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.</p>
    <p>You are advised to review these Terms periodically for any changes.</p>
