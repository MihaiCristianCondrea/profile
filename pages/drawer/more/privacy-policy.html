    <p>Welcome to Mihai's Profile Website ("me", "I", or "my"). I am committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how I collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit my website (the "Service"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the site.</p>
    <p>I reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. I will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last updated" date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates.</p>

    <h2>Information I Collect</h2>
    <p>I may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information I may collect on the Service includes:</p>

    <h3>Usage Data</h3>
    <p>Usage Data is collected automatically when you use the Service. This data may include information such as your Device's Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, browser version, the pages of my Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. This information is used for analytical purposes to improve my Service.</p>

    <h3>Client-Side Stored Data (Local Storage)</h3>
    <p>To enhance your experience, my Service utilizes browser local storage to remember certain preferences. Specifically, I may store:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Theme Preferences:</strong> Your selected theme (e.g., light, dark, or auto mode) is stored locally on your device so that your preference is remembered on subsequent visits. This data is stored only in your browser and is not transmitted to my servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data from Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>My Service integrates with and links to third-party services to provide certain functionalities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Blogger API (Google):</strong> To display the latest news/blog posts, I fetch data from the Blogger API. This involves using an API key configured within my application. Google's services are governed by their own <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>. I do not send any of your personal data to Blogger, nor do I receive personal data about you from Blogger, other than the public blog content.</li>
        <li><strong>External Links:</strong> My Service contains links to external websites (e.g., GitHub, social media platforms, Blogger, music platforms). If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</li>
    </ul>

    <md-divider></md-divider>

    <h2>Use of Your Information</h2>
    <p>Having accurate information permits me to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, I may use information collected about you via the Service to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide and maintain my Service, including monitoring the usage of my Service.</li>
        <li>Improve the Service by analyzing usage trends and user interaction.</li>
        <li>Remember your preferences (like theme settings) for subsequent visits.</li>
        <li>Respond to your direct inquiries if you contact me via the provided email address.</li>
    </ul>

    <md-divider></md-divider>

    <h2>Tracking Technologies (Cookies and Local Storage)</h2>
    <p>I primarily use browser <strong>Local Storage</strong> for functionality purposes as described above (e.g., theme settings). Local Storage data remains on your device until manually cleared by you.</p>
    <p>While my Service itself does not extensively use cookies for tracking users, some third-party services I link to or embed content from (like Blogger, Google Fonts, Font Awesome, or social media platforms) may use cookies or other tracking technologies. These are governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. You can typically manage cookie preferences through your browser settings.</p>

    <md-divider></md-divider>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>This website currently does not display third-party advertisements directly. However, please refer to my "Understanding Advertising in My Applications" page for information on how advertising may be used in other applications I develop. If I introduce advertising on this website in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly.</p>

    <md-divider></md-divider>

    <h2>Security of Your Information</h2>
    <p>I use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your information. While I have taken reasonable steps to secure the information I process (primarily aggregated usage data and client-side preferences), please be aware that despite my efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.</p>

    <md-divider></md-divider>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>My Service is not intended for individuals under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of digital consent in your jurisdiction). I do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided me with Personal Data without your consent, please contact me. If I become aware that I have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, I will take steps to remove that information.</p>

    <md-divider></md-divider>

    <h2>Your Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data, such as the right to access, correct, or delete information, or to object to certain processing. Since I collect minimal personal data directly through this Service, these rights primarily apply to the data held by third-party services you interact with through my links, or data stored locally in your browser (which you can clear).</p>
    <p>For data stored in your browser's local storage (like theme preferences), you can clear this data by clearing your browser's cache and site data.</p>

    <md-divider></md-divider>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
